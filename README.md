# reNamso v1.5 (2024 update)

### Fixed the bug that all cards ended in 0.

### Features

- **Removed Jquery Dependency**
- **Clean and rewritten Javascript code:** I modernized the code from almost 500 lines of the original Namso to only 160; using the most modern Javascript features.
- **Now the CCGEN use CSS variables** to edit the appearance of the generator: By editing the variables we can change all the colors of the Generator.
- **Clean HTML code: The HTML code** was cleaned up, formatted and I removed unused lines.
- **Accepts VISA, MASTERCARD, JBC, DISCOVER and DINERS CLUB cards;** I updated the generator so that it actually generates and gives the correct format depending on the type of BIN entered.
- **Multi-lang** The new CCGEN is available in English and Spanish. (Spanish on es.html)
